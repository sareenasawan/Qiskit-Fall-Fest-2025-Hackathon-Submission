Quantum Game Design Challenge: Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe (Qic-Qac-Qoe)

Concepts in quantum mechanics, such as superposition, entanglement, and measurement are difficult to visualize and understand, which inspired us to make this educational video game. It is influenced by the classic childhood game "Tic-Tac-Toe" to demonstrate these concepts visually in a fun and interactive way.
